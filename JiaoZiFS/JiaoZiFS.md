## Dataset linage management


![](./img/data-lineage.png)
Data lineage management for machine learning data flows recording and machine unlearning updating. For each step in the machine learning system, from the original dataset to optimizing each parameter in the training process to getting the final training results and analyzing the results, all data and changes will be recorded in the data lineage management system. This series of records of data flow characteristics and changes allow developers to control and track any subtle differences in the model learning process at any time

## Machine Learning Checkpointing

Checkpoints in Deep Learning
https://www.indusmic.com/post/checkpoints-in-deep-learning

Checkpointing in machine learning is the technique of preserving intermediate models throughout the training process to resume training from the most recent point in the event of a system breakdown or stoppage. It entails regularly preserving a neural network‚Äôs or checkpoint machine learning model‚Äôs weights, biases, and other parameters during training, restoring the model to a prior state if training is halted or fails.

Checkpointing, in addition to allowing the restart of training in the event of a failure or interruption, may be beneficial for monitoring the development of a model during training and spotting possible concerns early on. Saving the model at regular intervals allows you to monitor the model‚Äôs performance over time and find patterns or anomalies that may need attention.

### Design
The following are the general steps for checking a model:

1. Design the model architecture‚Äì Create your own deep learning model architecture or use pre-trained models.  
2. Optimizer and loss function‚Äì Choose the optimizer and loss function that will be utilized during training.  
3. Checkpointing directory‚Äì Set the directory where you want the model checkpoints saved.  
4. Checkpointing Callback‚Äì To store the model checkpoints, create a checkpointing callback object that will be invoked throughout training. This is possible with TensorFlow and Keras by using the ‚ÄòModelCheckpoint‚Äô function. To store the ckpt model in PyTorch, use the ‚Äòtorch.save()‚Äô method.  
5. Form the model‚Äì Use the ‚Äòfit()‚Äô function in TensorFlow or Keras or the ‚Äòtrain()‚Äô method in PyTorch to train the deep learning model. The checkpointing callback will store model checkpoints at predefined intervals throughout training.  
6. Load the checkpoints‚Äì In TensorFlow and Keras, use the ‚Äòload_weights()‚Äô function or the torch to restart training from a prior checkpoint. To load the stored model checkpoints, use PyTorch‚Äôs torch.load() method.  
7. To save time and resources and guarantee that your model is trained to its maximum potential, it is recommended to checkpoint deep learning models throughout training.

## Data Centric AI

Compared to model-centric AI, Data-centric AI pays more attention to data processing like data cleaning and labeling instead of model structure design, avoiding garbage in, garbage out.


**Streaming Data Sink.** JiaoziFS uses the sink to periodically collect the data from the connected streaming system and save it into different partitions. These data partitions will be tagged according to their arrival time and used for later training and evaluation.

**Pipeline Registry.** This module enables users to build a data-centric pipeline with ease by introducing flexible APIs. These APIs cover dataset I/O, pipeline staging, and running environment management, speeding up the development of a DataCI pipeline. Furthermore, a versioning control function is introduced to track the pipeline lineage.


**Data-centric Function Zoo.** we provide this module to store data processing methods such as data selection, data augmentation, and tricks applied in a specific scenario (e.g., prompting). Users can share and reuse the functions for pipeline building.

**Pipeline Orchestration.** To run a data-centric pipeline, we leverage the idea from pipeline orchestration systems like  Airflow. The data flow shown will pass through every pre-defined stage in the pipeline and then trigger the evaluation to test the whole pipeline and know the benefit of the new data-centric function. If the pipeline further passes the A/B test, the new function or the new pipeline can be deployed to the product.

**Leaderboard.** Once the evaluation is finished, the results will be sent to the leaderboard. We use the {run #No.} as the index and store the pipeline name with version, the evaluation dataset, the model name with training hype parameters, and the metric for easy reproduction and comparison.
