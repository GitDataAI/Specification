# Preface to the Third Edition


Since the first edition of the DataOps Cookbook in 2019, we have talked with thousands of companies about their struggles to deliver data-driven insight to their customers.  In many ways, they all have the same problems.  They have built data and analytic systems with great hope of success.  Still, they are burdened with too many errors, are overwhelmed with custom requests, and know they fail to succeed in their goal of leading their organizations to be more data-driven.

自2019年第一版DataOps Cookbook以来，我们与数千家公司讨论了他们在向客户提供数据驱动的洞察力方面所遇到的困难。在很多方面，他们都有同样的问题。他们建立了数据和分析系统，大有成功的希望。尽管如此，他们仍然背负着太多的错误，被自定义请求所淹没，并且知道他们无法成功实现领导组织更加数据驱动的目标。


And on top of that, they are all unhappy, stressed, and wondering what went wrong.  As an industry, we have a conceptual hole in how we think about data analytic systems.  We build them and put them into production, but then we hope all the steps data goes through from source to customer value work out correctly.  We all know that our customers frequently find data and dashboard problems.  Teams are shamed and blamed for problems they didn't cause.

最重要的是，他们都不开心，压力很大，想知道哪里出了问题。作为一个行业，我们对数据分析系统的看法存在概念漏洞。我们构建它们并将它们投入生产，但随后我们希望数据从来源到客户价值的所有步骤都能正确执行。我们都知道，我们的客户经常发现数据和仪表板问题。团队会因为不是他们造成的问题而受到羞辱和指责。

We had the same problem starting in 2005 when we left software development and started to lead data teams.  Over the years, we have put together these principles of DataOps, built multiple generations of software to solve the problem, and helped many customers succeed.  We talk with data teams every few days with the same “morning dread” I had lending data teams 15 years ago.  That feeling that something is going to go wrong, you’ll have no idea how to find it, and fixing it will put off all the other tasks that need to get done.

从2005年开始，当我们离开软件开发并开始领导数据团队时，我们也遇到了同样的问题。多年来，我们将DataOps的这些原则整合在一起，构建了多代软件来解决问题，并帮助许多客户取得了成功。我们每隔几天就会与数据团队交谈，就像我15年前借给数据团队时的“早晨恐惧”一样。你会觉得有些事情会出错，你不知道如何找到它，解决它会推迟所有其他需要完成的任务。

Enter 'Data Journey First DataOps.'  The new idea showcased in the third edition of the DataOps Cookbook is to focus first on understanding and observing the journey that data takes through your production environment - from ingestion to processing to delivering actionable insights.  This monitoring process identifies data errors, tool problems, and timing issues, enabling a quick win for your DataOps implementation by driving immediate improvements.  Lowering production errors increases the reliability of your data and gives your team more time to focus on automation.

输入“Data Journey First DataOps”。DataOps Cookbook第三版中展示的新思想是，首先关注于理解和观察数据在生产环境中的历程——从摄取到处理，再到提供可操作的见解。这个监控过程可以识别数据错误、工具问题和时间问题，通过推动即时改进，使您的DataOps实现快速获胜。降低生产错误可以提高数据的可靠性，并使团队有更多时间专注于自动化。
