# Introduction To The First Edition

In the early 2000s, Chris and Gil worked at a company that specialized in analytics for the pharmaceutical industry. It was a small company that offered a full suite of services related  to analytics — data engineering, data integration, visualization and what is now called “data science.” Their customers were marketing and sales executives who tend to be challenging because they are busy, need fast answers and don’t understand or care about the underlying mechanics of analytics. They are business people, not technologists.

21世纪初，克里斯和吉尔在一家专门为制药行业做分析的公司工作。它是一家提供全套分析相关服务的小公司——数据工程、数据集成、可视化以及现在所谓的“数据科学”。他们的客户是市场营销和销售主管，这些人往往具有挑战性，因为他们很忙，需要快速的答案，不理解或不关心分析的基本机制。他们是商人，不是技术专家。

When a request from a customer came in, Chris and Gil would gather their team of engineers, data scientists and consultants to plan out the how to get the project done. After days of planning, they would propose their project plan to the customer. “It will take two weeks.” The customer would shoot back, “I need it in two hours!”

当客户提出要求时，Chris和Gil会召集他们的工程师、数据科学家和顾问团队来计划如何完成项目。经过几天的计划，他们会向客户提出他们的项目计划。“需要两周时间。”顾客会反唇相讥:“我两个小时内就要!”

Walking back to their office, tail between their legs, they would pick up the phone. It was a customer boiling over with anger. There was a data error. If it wasn’t fixed immediately the customer would find a different vendor.

他们夹着尾巴走回办公室，拿起电话。那是一位怒气冲天的顾客。数据有误。如果不立即修复，客户就会找到其他供应商。

The company had hired a bunch of smart people to deliver these services. “ I want to innovate — Can I try out this new open source tool,” the team members would ask. “No,” the managers would have to answer. “We can’t afford to introduce technical risk.”

公司雇佣了一群聪明人来提供这些服务。“我想要创新——我可以尝试一下这个新的开源工具吗?”团队成员会这样问。“不，”经理们不得不回答。“我们承担不起引入技术风险。”

They lived this life for many years. How do you create innovative data analytics? How do you not have embarrassing errors? How do you let your team easily try new ideas? There had to be a better way.

他们这样生活了很多年。如何创建创新的数据分析?你怎么能不犯尴尬的错误呢?你如何让你的团队轻松尝试新想法?一定有更好的办法。

They found their answer by studying the software and manufacturing industries which had been struggling with these same issues for decades. They discovered that data-analytics cycle time and quality can be optimized with a combination of tools and methodologies that they now call DataOps. They decided to start a new company. The new organization adopted the kitchen metaphor for data analytics. After all, cooking up charts and graphs requires the right ingredients and recipes.

他们通过研究软件和制造业找到了答案，这些行业几十年来一直在与这些问题作斗争。他们发现，数据分析周期的时间和质量可以通过他们现在称之为DataOps的工具和方法的组合来优化。他们决定开一家新公司。这个新组织采用了厨房的比喻来进行数据分析。毕竟，制作图表和图形需要正确的原料和配方。

The DataKitchen founders (Chris, Gil and Eric) built their own DataOps Platform. What hap- pened next was remarkable. When analytics go faster, users embrace analytics and innovate. Rapid, high-quality analytics can unlock an organization’s creative potential.

datakkitchen的创始人(Chris, Gil和Eric)建立了他们自己的DataOps平台。接下来发生的事情很不寻常。当分析变得更快时，用户就会接受分析和创新。快速、高质量的分析可以释放组织的创造潜力。

Having experienced this transformation, the DataKitchen founders sought a way to help other data professionals. There are so many talented people stuck in no-win situations. This book is for data professionals who are living the nightmare of slow, buggy analytics and frustrated users. It will explain why working weekends isn’t the answer. It provides you with practical steps that you can take tomorrow to improve your analytics cycle time.

在经历了这种转变之后，datakkitchen的创始人寻求一种方法来帮助其他数据专业人士。有太多有才华的人陷入了没有胜算的境地。这本书是为那些生活在缓慢、错误的分析和沮丧的用户噩梦中的数据专业人士而写的。它将解释为什么周末工作不是解决问题的办法。它为你提供了实际的步骤，你可以采取明天来改善你的分析周期时间。
